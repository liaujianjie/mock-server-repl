Handy tool to start and expose Express apps. Useful for manual experimentation of load balancing
policies.

```
yarn        # install deps
yarn start  # start app
```

### REPL functions

```sh
list()       # list all ports that are currently listened to
listen(123)  # listens at port number 123
kill(123)    # stops listening at port number 123

quit()
```
